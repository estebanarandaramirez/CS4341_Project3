To run this project, Project3.py can be run with two csvs as parameter.
The first CSV should be board states with winner
The second CSV will be rewritten with board states and evaluation of the features.

If interested, FeatureExtraction.py can be run with the board states as csv1 input with any csv as a second input.
It will generate a new csv called features.csv that will just list the results of each feature across each row.
